Minimum Spanning Tree



Spanning tree - It is a tree where there is N nodes and N-1 edges , also all nodes are reachable from each other . (It is undirected and weighted )

There can be more than 1 spanning tree in a graph and the minimum among them is called as the minimum spanning tree
(The minimum is calculated using the sum of all the edge weights that we take in the spanning tree)
